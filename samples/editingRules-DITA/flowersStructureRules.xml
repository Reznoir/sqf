      <title>Care and Preparation</title>
      <p>When caring for your flower garden you want to feed your plants properly, control pests and
        weeds. Good soil is a must to successful gardening, landscaping, and healthy flowers. You
        have to balance the soil structure with nutrients and regulate the pH to cover your plants'
        needs. And above all, remember that many flower gardens fail because they just don't get
        enough of your attention.</p>
